                        <p>i sometimes do art commissions where i draw emotes for people's tabletop rpg characters.
                            this is a calculator i coded to figure out how much certain commissions would cost.

                    <p>my response to the coding challenge i submitted in my ada application.
                        the idea was to create a program that could calculate the total expenses 
                        per group attending the fictional "ada county fair" (not the real one in boise).
                        i'd like to think i've come a long way from here!</p>

                    <p>my very first project as a cohort 14 adie student. yes, it's another calculator. no, it doesn't do as much
                        as a real calculator, but it has some fancy user validation tricks that i thought were neat (at the time).
                        it also helped me conquer a weird fear of regex.</p>

                    <p>a CLI program written at ada to learn about some of our planets in the solar system. currently only supports two planets,
                        but i'd say they're pretty neat ones. you can even add info about your own! disclaimer: all user-provided info cannot be verified for accuracy.</p>

                    <p>library code written for an ada project to store orders of a grocery store using object-oriented programming. it was one 
                        of the first projects where we'd be writing our own program tests.</p>

                    <p>an in-progress, open-source owlbot for the #nightowl channel in the ada cohort 14 slack. mostly for 
                        late night hooting needs and summoning cohort 14's night owls. one day it might just be a ruby on rails
                        app. #hoot</p>
